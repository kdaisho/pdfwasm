Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Improve search highlight rendering

## Context
Text search highlights are drawn per-character using exact PDFium bounding boxes. This makes highlights hard to see because each character has a slightly different height (e.g., "a" vs "T") and there are tiny gaps between character boxes. The goal is to render highlights as continuous, full-height rectangles — like browser-style text selection.

## Change

**File:** `src/lib/components/PdfPage.svelte` — modify `drawMatch()` (lines 97-116)

Instead of drawing one `fillRect()` per character, merge all characters in a match into a single bounding rectangle:

1. Iterate all chars in the match to compute:
   - `minLeft` = min of all `c.left`
   - `maxRight` = max of all `c.right`
   - `minBottom` = min of all `c.bottom`
   - `maxTop` = max of all `c.top`
2. Convert the merged box with `pdfToCanvas(minLeft, maxRight, minBottom, maxTop, ...)`
3. Draw one `fillRect()` for the entire match

**Multi-line handling:** If a match spans multiple lines, characters will have very different Y coordinates. Group characters into lines (detect line breaks when `top` values diverge by more than half the char height), then draw one merged rect per line.

## Verification
- `pnpm run dev` — open a PDF, search for a word
- Confirm highlights are full-height continuous rectangles with no gaps
- Test with multi-line matches (if applicable) and single-character matches
- Verify active (orange) vs non-active (yellow) highlights still render correctly
