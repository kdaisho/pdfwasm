Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Integrate Skeleton UI into pdfwasm

## Context

The project currently uses hand-written scoped CSS with hardcoded colors. We want to bring in **Skeleton v4** (skeleton.dev) as the UI component library to get a polished, themeable design system with dark mode support. Skeleton is built on Tailwind CSS 4 and provides both Tailwind utility classes and pre-built Svelte components.

## Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm add -D @skeletonlabs/skeleton @skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte tailwindcss
```

Skeleton v4 requires: SvelteKit 2+ (have it), Svelte 5+ (have it), Tailwind 4+.

## Step 2: Create global stylesheet with Skeleton imports

Replace `src/app.css` content with:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';
@import '@skeletonlabs/skeleton';
@import '@skeletonlabs/skeleton-svelte';
@import '@skeletonlabs/skeleton/themes/rocket';
```

This sets up Tailwind 4 + Skeleton's design tokens + the `rocket` theme.

## Step 3: Add theme attribute to `app.html`

Update `<html lang="en">` to `<html lang="en" data-theme="rocket">`.

## Step 4: Migrate `+page.svelte` toolbar

Replace hand-written toolbar with Skeleton components:
- **AppBar** for the top toolbar (title + buttons)
- Skeleton button classes (`btn preset-filled`) for "Open PDF" and "Split Mode"
- Use Skeleton's text/color utilities for status/error messages

## Step 5: Migrate `SearchBar.svelte`

- Use Skeleton's form input classes for the search input
- Use Skeleton's button/chip classes for the toggle buttons (Aa, W)
- Use Skeleton's badge or text styles for match count
- Navigation buttons (↑↓) use Skeleton button variants

## Step 6: Migrate `PdfViewer.svelte` split toolbar

- Use Skeleton's Slider component or styled range input
- Export button uses Skeleton button preset classes
- Split info text uses Skeleton typography utilities

## Step 7: Remove old scoped CSS

As each component is migrated, remove the `<style>` blocks that are replaced by Tailwind utility classes and Skeleton component classes. Keep any layout-specific CSS that isn't covered by Skeleton (e.g., canvas overlay positioning, split grid layout).

## Files to modify

1. `package.json` — new dependencies (via pnpm)
2. `src/app.css` — replace with Skeleton/Tailwind imports
3. `src/app.html` — add `data-theme`
4. `src/routes/+page.svelte` — toolbar → AppBar + Skeleton classes
5. `src/lib/components/SearchBar.svelte` — inputs/buttons → Skeleton classes
6. `src/lib/components/PdfViewer.svelte` — split toolbar → Skeleton classes

Files NOT modified (no UI changes needed):
- `src/lib/components/PdfPage.svelte` — canvas rendering, keep as-is
- `src/lib/services/*` — business logic, untouched

## Verification

1. `pnpm run dev` — dev server starts without errors
2. `pnpm run check` — TypeScript/Svelte check passes
3. Visual check: theme applied, toolbar styled, search bar functional, split mode works
4. Dark mode toggle test (if applicable via theme)

now, it got worse. the button for opening PDF doesn't look like a button anymore

---

tailwindcss will tree-shake with my setup?

---

what do you mean by "You'd only lose tree-shaking"? Would I lose the classname in prod?

---

i see `<header data-scope="app-bar" data-part="root">`, who inserts data-scope: app-bar and data-part: root? Skeleton?

---

ok i want to add space between viewport edge and elements. i don't see browser default style that insert padding or margin, so i think it's good as a clean slate, but now I don't want the text 'PDF Viewer' and Open PDF button stick to the edge of screen.

---

ok nice. i chose theme of rocket from Skeleton, but it's not colorful enought than i expected. do we need to do by ourselves?

---

i accidentally set 'text-primary-500' to h1, and it shows a nice blue color. where does it come from? Tailwind?

---

is there a list of css class from Skeleton? i can't remember everything
